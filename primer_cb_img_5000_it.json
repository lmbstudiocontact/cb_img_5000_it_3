    "One explanation for this finding could be related to the sequence characteristics of the molecular beacons and adjacent primers.",
    "A presence/absence matrix was constructed for each band ampli®ed with the eight primers for each of the isolates analysed.",
    "Sequencing was performed in both directions using the amplification primers.",
    "However, the small number of primers and isolates used precludes wider interpretation of these data.",
    "The two primers, which then were adopted for the definitive study, provided good reproducibility, although the intensity of the bands was variable in some cases.",
    "Multiple sequencing primers were used to obtain complete sequence of the 1600-bp fragment with each clone having, on average, 5-fold sequence coverage."
