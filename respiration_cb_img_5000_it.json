    "Biogeophysical factors influencing soil respiration and mineral nitrogen content in an old field soil.",
    "In respiration and photosynthesis processes, small redox-active metalloproteins facilitate electron-transfer reactions by alternately binding to specific integral membrane proteins that often contain several metal sites.",
    "In contrast, they found late successional species to have lower rates of dark respiration, low mesophyll conductance and low light compensation points.",
    "The physico-chemistry of affinities and of fermentation, which concerns respiration, chyliation, glandular secretion, reproduction, etc., does not modify the givens of the problem.",
    "We found this effect in petite (aerobic respiration incompetent) strains but not grande (respiration competent) strains.",
    "Respiration rates can be measured more easily and reliably than the diesel concentration itself.",
    "Movements that follow respiration reflect increases and decreases in venous pressure that accompany inflation and deflation of the chest.",
    "As discussed earlier, these differences would likely have been 2-4 fold higher had a half-hour respiration incubation time been used."
