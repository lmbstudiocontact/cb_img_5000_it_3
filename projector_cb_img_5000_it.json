    "For example, consider a proposal to install projectors, screens, and resident computers in all classrooms on campus.",
    "A neuron's receptive field was first manually mapped with a hand projector to determine its location, ocular dominance, eccentricity, and approximate preferred orientation.",
    "However, in tests where an auxiliary image was used, the projector group was followed by the monitor group in its performance of collision frequency.",
    "This was accomplished by controlling the galvanometer with a signal from the white projector which indicated the position of its projected increment.",
    "This might include light control blinds, motors, sound equipment, public address system, video projectors, deployable screens, smoke detectors, fibre-optics, electrical cabling and tracks.",
    "In addition, the projector group and the monitor group carried out their respective best performance in differing test conditions.",
    "The instructor put seven sample sentences of this type on the overhead projector.",
    "The auxiliary lateral image was a significant factor for the projector group-and the monitor group in collision frequency."
