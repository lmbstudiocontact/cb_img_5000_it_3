    "The driving forces for such cycles provide endless scope for debate, given the complex inter-relations of processes in the atmosphere, oceans, biosphere and lithosphere.",
    "The book has a simple but logical structure, being divided into seven chapters, the four most substantive dealing with atmosphere, continental solids, continental waters and the oceans.",
    "The fourth edition places greater emphasis than before on earth systems and environmental topics, and retains the expanded chapter on the oceans involved in the third edition.",
    "Effective mixing of the early oceans drastically reduces the required time and is hence a vital ingredient in understanding the homochiralization process.",
    "Bats are relatively small and ephemeral habitats (compared with forests, prairies or oceans).",
    "However, that is generally not the case in the real atmosphere and oceans, and that fact turns out to be most pertinent in the long-wave theory.",
    "The surfaces of all three planets might have been partially covered with oceans and/or lakes, and therefore provided suitable habitats for life at that time.",
    "Model scales range from whole oceans to single stretches of shoreline, to groups of a few current ripples."
