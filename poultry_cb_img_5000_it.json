    "Poultry products constitute a major source of infection for humans [2], and over the years various serotypes have emerged in poultry populations.",
    "Along small rivers it is commonplace that poultry die from polluted water and fodder.",

    "Thus, it is reasonable to assume that most of the serotype 2 strains found in the poultry and cattle reservoirs are pathogenic to humans.",
    "An infestation might well damage poultry farms and fisheries, but it was for the industries to protect their stock as best they could.",
    "The food isolates consisted of 43 samples of cooked meats, 20 egg isolates and 34 poultry isolates.",
    "Poultry may have been ubiquitous, but they still had a cultural origin in a (historical) process of plantation.",
    "Among the four systems compared, a system with cover crop, poultry manure, and no-till faired the best."
