    "The maximum water-holding capacity of moss was estimated from the difference between moist and dry weight.",
    "The moss was burnt off the willow stocks and in some cases the heat discoloured and even damaged the bark of the stocks.",
    "Reduced litter loads and a greater quantity of moss were two key responses.",
    "Only occasional spot spraying of fern regrowth is required after moss is established.",
    "There is moderate species richness in the mosses colonising buildings.",
    "Other contaminants should also be considered, especially aerosols and particulate accumulations in snow ablation zones and moss sites adjacent to the runway site.",
    "The four variables were: cover by higher plants, litter, moss and soil surface depressions, stratified towards the soil surface in that order.",
    "Non-vascular species were recorded within 95 sample plots and totalled 2 2 mosses, 66 liverworts and 4 6 macrolichens."
