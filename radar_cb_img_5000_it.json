    "One considerable advance in the technique of fighter defence is that we have re-equipped our early warning system round our coast with new types of radars.",
    "Does that mean that new radars would be provided in the event that such provision were required?",
    "In addition, there are plans to set up decoy radars and passive electronic sensors around the country.",
    "The people manning their radars have been extremely reluctant to switch them on except for very short periods of time.",
    "Modernisation of existing early warning radars is not prohibited by the treaty.",
    "The people who pick it up on their radars believe that it will be used.",
    "All radars will be brought up to the full technical standard, beginning next year.",
    "However, the maintenance, engineering support and operation of the radars and associated equipment has been carried out under contract since 1964."
