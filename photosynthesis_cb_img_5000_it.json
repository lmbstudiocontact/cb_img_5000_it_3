    "Photosynthetic induction strongly affects the light compensation point of net photosynthesis and coincidentally the apparent quantum yield.",
    "It is difficult to determine whether the results reflect the history of photosynthesis.",
    "Therefore, maximizing the proportion of leaves within the canopy will increase overall photosynthesis.",
    "This then allows photosynthesis to operate effectively over a wide range of incident light-intensities.",
    "After these immediate measurements, samples were then placed on ice and tested for active photosynthesis at various time intervals afterward.",
    "Either the purple bacteria have acquired the photosynthesis genes recently by lateral gene transfer or selective pressure forced various species to retain these organizational patterns.",
    "Understanding photosynthesis is important for understanding life, the development of the atmosphere on earth and possibly renewable hydrogen generation in the future.",
    "The basis of photosynthesis is the trapping of light energy from the sun by chlorophyll."
