    "The entire performance is controlled by several independent video and audio mixers, each with its own operator.",
    "Diffusion, as the performance mode for these sounds, refers to the distribution of the (usually stereo) sound in a space through the use of a mixer and multiple loudspeakers.",
    "Finally, in extremely large halls, speakers placed immediately by the mixer can help overcome the sensation that the sound is predominantly at the periphery of the listening space.",
    "In addition to a one-off delay, you can feed the delayed sound back to record (via a mixer) thus creating electronic canons of what is played.",
    "Each has a separate output allowing the signals to be routed to separate devices for processing or to multiple channels on a mixer.",
    "Two or three technicians are also required in order to operate the tape, mixer and effects.",
    "There exist, however, some modern mixers that are able to pan sounds to certain multi-loudspeaker configurations.",
    "This procedure is created in response to the single goal \"trap the dough in the mixer\"."
