    "A further advantage applicable to low-temperature environments is that diurnal freeze-thaw cycles might be mitigated, reducing freeze-thaw stress to the microbes.",
    "The early microbe hunters knew this, and they took the task of cash-out seriously.",
    "Instead, like microbes that are essentially too small to see, he would have appeared other than as he essentially was.",

    "Except in special circumstances where one may be looking for specific microbes, the knowledge gained by viable counts is minimal for biomass estimations."
