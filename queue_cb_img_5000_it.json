    "Optimization models are being used increasingly in the design of a variety of systems where queuing phenomena arise.",
    "The speed of the total process requires a large number of par ts to be queued between stages.",
    "In networks, we often deal with sums of state variables, such as the sum of customers in several queues.",
    "The study of such a model provides insights at the queue length (and thus the congestion of a junction) under a heavy load.",
    "Such a queue can be easily implemented as a circular array of task pointers.",
    "Since this is not a desirable behaviour, we will enhance our simple processor with a waiting queue for tasks.",
    "Also, the presence of infection can very rapidly endanger the lives of those waiting faithfully in the queue for their treatment.",
    "Several pharmacy users commented on the knowledge and training of the pharmacists, although most also remarked about the difficulties of being overheard in the queue."
