    "A pianist (1967) who spends roughly a tenth of the time writing for music magazines.",
    "For example, the experienced pianist responds with a voice of expertise: 'could have practised more', 'original and good for someone who doesn't play the piano'.",
    "This may ease the synchronisation for the pianist, while at the same time providing cues.",
    "The tape has a percussive sound at 13915.50, and the pianist is to come in a half second later.",
    "A broken finger will likely have more significance for a professional pianist than for a retired poker player.",
    "With appropriate cues, the pianist is constantly reminded of the exact tempo and directed to the next phrase at the right time.",
    "The pianist is encouraged to experiment with the timing with chunks of 30 seconds of music to determine how the piano part flows.",
    "Involuntary motor activity in pianists evoked by music perception."
