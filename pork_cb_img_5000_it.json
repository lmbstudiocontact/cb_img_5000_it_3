    "Thus, politicians now have less incentive to bring pork-barrel to their district.",
    "Under a system in which politicians needed extensive support in their constituencies, pork-barrel is not a very effective strategy.",
    "Nor did measures of access or pork-barrel politics affect the aggregate pattern.",
    "Therefore, pre-harvest (preslaughter) prevalence data can be useful in improving pork safety.",
    "First, pork-barrel policies only benefit a small group of farmers, and most voters will not enjoy the benefits of such policies.",
    "All the breed groups represented had pork loins that scored below 2% marbling and 3 for visual color scores.",
    "We derive hypotheses from a model of competitive bidding, the official evaluation of the programme and the pork-barrel literature.",
    "A more striking observation is the consistent effect of selection for lean growth efficiency on the ability of fresh pork to hold water."
